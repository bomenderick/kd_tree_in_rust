# kd_tree_in_rust
A K dimensional tree with n-nearest neighbors search implemented in Rust

## The implementation supporting the following operations:

* new() -> Create an empty k-d tree
* build() -> Generate a balance k-d tree from a vector of points
* insert() -> Add a point to a k-d tree
* delete() -> Remove a point from a k-d tree
* contains() -> Search for a point in a k-d tree
* n_nearest_neighbors -> Search the nearest neighbors of a given point from a k-d tree with their respective distances
* len() -> Determine the number of points stored in a kd-tree
* is_empty() -> Determine whether or not there are points in a k-d tree
*
